# Scheduling single round robin competitions

The project consists of two separate codebases:

* [Python code (`project/`)](project/): Python implementations of the traditional formulation, the matching formulation and permutation formulation. The code is used for computing relaxations.
* [C code (`project_c/`)](project_c/): A C-implementation of the matching formulation, with pricer and brancher.

We refer to the README.md and INSTALL.md files in these directories.
