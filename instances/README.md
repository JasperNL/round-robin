# Problem instances for SRR

These files are generated by [`../project/solve_generate_testsets.py`](../project/solve_generate_testsets.py), and follow a straightforward format:

1. First line: The number of teams
2. All remaining lines specify the cost coefficients of matches $`c_{\{i, j\}, r}`$. Four space (or tab)-separated columns. The first two columns specify the match (team `i`, team `j`), the third column the round index `r`, and the last column the cost coefficient (floating point number). If the cost is not specified, it is assumed to be zero.
